                                Ellen Ochoa (born May 10, 1958) is an American engineer, former astronaut and former Director of the Johnson Space Center.
                                In 1993, Ochoa became the first Hispanic woman in the world to go to space when she served on a nine-day mission aboard the shuttle Discovery.
                                As Chief of the Intelligent Systems Technology Branch at Ames, she supervised 35 engineers and scientists in the research and development of 
                                computational systems for aerospace missions.

                                Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (December 9, 1906 â€“ January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.
                                One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. 
                                She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, 
                                an early high-level programming language still in use today.
